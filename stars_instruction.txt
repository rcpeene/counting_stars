Goal of this effort is to count number of stars on
the picture provided. The goal is not to reach
the optimal and best counter but to evaluate
how you write clear, versioned and documented
code and how you evaluate an algorithm
performance. It is fine it the counter does not
work well as long as you provide performance
measurements that reflect this. You can install
and import packages that you find relevant to
this task. Make sure to share any environment
condition (conda or else) so that I can replicate
your result.

- Create a private GITHUB repository to hold
your work
- Push the image and all relevant code needed
to replicate your result
- No jupyter notebook should be committed to
the repo: Part of the goal is to see how you
structure this task with python functions,
modules, scripts and classes of your choosing.
Write clear code, with clean variable names,
well-defined functions with modularity in mind.
No documentation required.
- Make sure to give time to evaluate the
performance in a way you decide. HINTS: False

Positive and False negative rates or similar
metrics should be part of your evaluation.
- I will expect to evaluate your repository in one
week from our first interview. Use as much time
as you wish within that timeframe.
- Please work alone on the coding part. The
goal is also to make sure you would be a good
fit for this job and as a result be happy in this
role. You are welcome to leverage the internet
in any ways.
